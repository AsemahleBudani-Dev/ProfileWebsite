                <h3>Hi, I'm Asemahle Budani, currently pursuing a Computer Science Degree at the University of The Western Cape & Full-Stack Engineer professional certificate at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">CodeAcademy</a></h3>
                <article>
                    <p>I am 21 years old that is fascinated by web pages, applications and algorithms. </br> I am a passionate and dedicated individual with a strong interest in technology and programming. I have a solid foundation in computer science principles and a keen desire to learn and grow in the field of software development. </br>Computer Science has aided me in understanding the thought process of Computers, from binary code to the languages that we now use for Computers. </p>

                <div class="About-me"><p>The fundamentals of Computer Science have given me a proper understanding and experience of backend engineering. In my first year, we learnt about GitHub, Git and the language we used was Python. I also had a Physical Science module which surprisingly during its practicals we used python for analysis, thus gaining experience in using Python packages like Numpy and Pandas. The following year we use Java and learnt about algorithms, my love for algorithms began that year. I have linked my github, there you will find the algorithms I have built. I am pursuing the full-stack engineer professional certificate because I want to learn more about websites and applications and their deployments.</p>
