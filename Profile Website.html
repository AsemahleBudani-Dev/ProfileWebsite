                    <p>I am Asemahle Budani, currently an aspiring full-stack engineer, and this website is one of my first projects that I have worked on.<br>
                        What led me to wanting to become a full-stack engineer?<br>
                        Well, it is the discovery of how much code controls what we daily use, from small things such as controlling the use of earphones up to launching rockets into orbit.</p>

                <aside>
                    <p>I have never even dreamt of becoming a full-stack engineer. All I ever wanted was to become a Physicist in High School. Well, those dreams of becoming a Physicist became dull as I discovered that Maths is not my friend in University.</p>
